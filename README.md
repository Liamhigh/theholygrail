# Verum Omnis - Forensic Engine

Verum Omnis is a powerful, stateless, and secure forensic analysis engine. It leverages the Google Gemini API to perform deep analysis on legal documents, images, and other evidence, producing comprehensive, court-ready forensic reports.

Built as a Progressive Web App (PWA), it runs entirely on-device, ensuring user data is never uploaded or stored on external servers. It is designed for cross-platform use, functioning seamlessly in modern web browsers and as a native Android application via Capacitor.

**🌍 Free for Every Private Citizen on the Planet** - This forensic engine is provided free of charge to all private citizens worldwide, empowering individuals with professional-grade forensic analysis tools for personal legal matters.

## **No Backend Architecture - Forensics on Your Device**

**This application does NOT use a backend server for forensic analysis.** All forensic processing, evidence analysis, and report generation happen 100% on the user's device (browser or mobile app). Your evidence files never leave your device during the forensic analysis process.

- ✅ **All forensic analysis runs locally** on your device using the Google Gemini API directly from the browser
- ✅ **Evidence files stay on your device** - stored in IndexedDB (local browser storage)
- ✅ **Reports are generated locally** - PDF creation happens in-browser
- ✅ **No server-side processing** - no backend receives or processes your evidence
- ⚠️ **Optional metadata sync only** - Firebase integration (if configured) only syncs case metadata, never evidence files or forensic analysis results

## Key Features

-   **🆓 Free for All Private Citizens:** Available at no cost to every private citizen worldwide for personal legal matters.
-   **100% Client-Side Forensic Processing:** All forensic analysis is performed securely on your device (in the browser or mobile app), guaranteeing privacy and confidentiality. No backend server processes your evidence.
-   **Multi-modal Evidence Analysis:** Supports a wide range of file types including text, `.txt`, `.pdf`, and common image formats (`.png`, `.jpg`, etc.).
-   **Dynamic Model Selection:** Automatically utilizes `gemini-2.5-flash` for general cases and `gemini-2.5-pro` with an enhanced thinking budget for more complex evidence like PDFs.
-   **Structured Forensic Reports:** Generates highly-structured reports in Markdown, detailing executive summaries, timelines, liability assessments, strategic recommendations, and more.
-   **Cryptographically Sealed PDFs:** Allows users to download reports as PDFs secured with a SHA-256 cryptographic seal, verifying the document's integrity.
-   **Device-Only Storage:** Evidence and reports are stored locally in IndexedDB on your device - never uploaded to external servers.
-   **Offline-First & Installable:** Fully functional without an internet connection for case preparation. It can be installed on any device as a PWA.
-   **Production Ready:** Configured for deployment on Firebase Hosting (static files only) and for building into a native Android application with Capacitor.

## Tech Stack

-   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite
-   **AI:** Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`)
-   **PDF Generation:** jsPDF
-   **Native Runtime:** Capacitor
-   **Hosting:** Firebase Hosting (static files only)
-   **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions

## Architecture: How Forensics Work on Your Device

### Web Version (Browser)
1. User uploads evidence files → stored in browser's IndexedDB
2. Click "Analyze" → Gemini API called directly from browser (API key embedded at build time)
3. AI analysis happens via Gemini's servers, but **evidence files never leave your device**
4. Report generated locally in browser → can be exported as PDF

### APK Version (Android App)
1. User uploads evidence files → stored in device's IndexedDB
2. Click "Analyze" → Gemini API called directly from the app (API key embedded in APK at build time)
3. AI analysis happens via Gemini's servers, but **evidence files never leave your device**
4. Report generated locally on device → can be exported as PDF

### Key Points:
- **No backend server** - The app doesn't have or need a backend server for forensic processing
- **API key embedded at build time** - Both web and APK builds include the Gemini API key via `VITE_API_KEY`
- **Evidence stays local** - Files are stored in IndexedDB and never uploaded to any server
- **Direct API calls** - The app calls Google Gemini API directly from browser/device
- **Optional Firebase** - If configured, Firebase only syncs case metadata (not evidence files or analysis results)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or later)
-   npm (v8 or later)

### Local Development

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/verum-omnis-engine.git
    cd verum-omnis-engine
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **API Key Configuration:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Google Gemini API key:
    ```
    VITE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
    ```
    This key is used for AI-powered forensic analysis and is embedded into builds (both web and APK) at build time.

4.  **Run the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Build and Deployment

### Production Web Build

To create an optimized production build of the web app:

```bash
npm run build
```

The output files will be generated in the `dist/` directory.

### Firebase Hosting

This project is configured for continuous deployment to Firebase Hosting. Every push to the `main` branch triggers the GitHub Actions workflow defined in `.github/workflows/firebase-hosting.yml`. This workflow automatically builds and deploys the application.

For the workflow to succeed, you must configure the following secrets in your GitHub repository settings:
-   `VITE_API_KEY`: Your Google Gemini API key.
-   `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_VERUM_OMNIS_ENGINE`: The JSON content of your Firebase service account key.

## Mobile Development (Capacitor)

The APK is a fully functional forensic engine that runs entirely on the device. To build the Android app:

1.  **Configure API Key:**
    Ensure your `.env` file contains your Gemini API key (this will be embedded in the APK at build time):
    ```
    VITE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
    ```

2.  **Build the Web Assets:**
    Ensure you have a fresh production build with the API key embedded.
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

3.  **Initialize the Android Platform (First time only):**
    This only needs to be done once to add the native Android project.
    ```bash
    npx cap add android
    ```

4.  **Sync Web Assets with Android Project:**
    This command copies your web build from `dist/` into the native Android project. Run this command every time you update your web code.
    ```bash
    npx cap sync
    ```

5.  **Open in Android Studio:**
    ```bash
    npx cap open android
    ```
    From Android Studio, you can run the app on an emulator or a connected physical device.
